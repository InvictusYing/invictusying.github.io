Hi there! 😃

My name is Zhongying and I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in Geography at the University of Colorado Boulder, supervised by Prof. [Morteza Karimzadeh][mk] at the GeoHAI Lab. My work lies at the intersection of AI and Geography (GeoAI). My research focuses on **GeoAI methods for environmental health and public health applications**. In particular, I work on high-resolution air pollution estimation using satellite, ground and simulation data; spatiotemporal deep learning and data fusion for geospatial prediction; and geospatial foundation models and pretrained location encoders.
