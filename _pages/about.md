Hi there! ðŸ˜ƒ

My name is Zhongying and Iâ€™m a second-year PhD student in the Department of Geography at CU Boulder, supervised by Prof. [Morteza Karimzadeh][mk] at the GeoHAI Lab. My work lies at the intersection of AI and Geography (GeoAI). My current research focus on (1) Deep learning-based infectious disease forecasting, and (2) Air pollution Downscaling.
